Pin was made with Swift as a response to the infamous "Yo" app that had gotten a lot of attention.

Usage
---
Pin requires no login. Just enter your phone number and your contact list should instantly populate with other users who have the Pin app based on your address book.

### Sending your location
At first launch, sending your location will require that you give Pin access to your current location. After you've given permissions, the app will send your location to the selected user.

### Recieving a friend's location
Your iOS 8 device will be alerted once you have receieved a notification. From within the new notification in iOS 8, you'll have an ability to view the map or you can simply just tap the map from the Pin app.

### New contacts
Pin populates your contact list based off your address book. If you have added a new number but do not see them in your friend list, simply swipe-to-refresh.

Get the App

Because this project was done entirely with Apple's new programming language Swift, Pin should be available in the app store as soon as iOS 8 launches.
